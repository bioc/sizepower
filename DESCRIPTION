Description: This package has been prepared to assist users in
        computing either a sample size or power value for a microarray
        experimental study. The user is referred to the cited
        references for technical background on the methodology
        underpinning these calculations. This package provides support
        for five types of sample size and power calculations. These
        five types can be adapted in various ways to encompass many of
        the standard designs encountered in practice.
